    <h1>Asymmetric Cryptography Basics</h1>
    <p>
      This article introduces the fundamentals of Asymmetric Cryptography (Public Key Cryptography), commonly used ciphers, and their roles.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <section class="content-block">
        <p>Requirements in the cyber realm:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Authenticity</b>: Ensure you are communicating with the right person and verify the source of information.</li>
          <li><b>Integrity</b>: Ensure that no one alters the data you exchange.</li>
          <li><b>Confidentiality</b>: Prevent eavesdropping on the conversation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Cryptography provides a way to satisfy these requirements.</p>

      <h2>Common Uses</h2>
      <section class="content-block">
        <dl>
          <dt><b>Secure Key Exchange</b></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Symmetric cryptography is faster, but both parties need the same secret key. Asymmetric cryptography allows them to exchange a session key securely, after which they switch to symmetric cryptography for speed.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt><b>Encryption for Confidentiality</b></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>A sender encrypts a message with the recipient's public key. Only the recipient, with the corresponding private key, can decrypt it.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt><b>Digital Signatures</b></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>The sender signs data with their private key. Anyone can verify the signature using the sender's public key. This provides authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt><b>Authentication</b></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Systems can prove their identity using public/private key pairs instead of passwords. Example: SSH login with key-based authentication.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt><b>Digital Certificates</b></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Used in SSL/TLS for HTTPS, digital certificates prove website authenticity and enable secure encrypted connections. Public key cryptography is at the core of this trust system.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt><b>Cryptocurrency and Blockchain</b></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Users have private keys that sign transactions and public keys that others use to verify them. This ensures ownership, prevents tampering, and secures blockchain transactions.</p>
          </dd>

      <h2>RSA</h2>
      <section class="content-block">
        <p>
          RSA is a public-key cryptography algorithm used to secure data. Security comes ftom the difficulty of factoring very large numbers (multiplying is easy,
          factoring back is hard). It uses key sizes of 1024bits, 2048bits, 3072bits or 4096bits(309, 617, 925, 1234 digits), while the prime numbers used are about half 
          that size.

      <h3>What is modulo (%)?</h3>
      <section class="content-block">
        <p>
          Modulo operation is defined as the reminder of a number when divided by another number.
          % symbol is used. E.g. 151 / 50 = 3 remainder 1 so 151 % 30 = 1. 7428 % 536 = 460.
          For the math in the following example, <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/" target="_blank">Wolfram Alpha</a> can be used.

      <h3>How it works</h3>
      <section class="content-block">
        <p>
          We'll follow the classic analogy of Bob and Alice:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><p>Bob chooses two prime numbers: <b>p = 10007</b> and <b>q = 99991</b>. He calculates <b>n = p * q = 1000609937</b></p></li>
          <li><p>Let <b>T</b> (Totient) <b>= (p-1)(q-1) = 1000499940</b></p></li>
          <li><p><b>e</b> is a number relatively prime to <b>T</b>, usually 65537</p></li>
          <li><p><b>d</b> is another number, such that <b>(e * d) % T = 1</b>. In our case d = 662506613</p></li>
          <li><p>The public key is <b>(n, e) i. e. (1000609937, 65537)</b>. The private key is <b>(n, d) = (1000609937, 662506613)</b></p></li>
          <li><p>Let's say the value we want to encrypt is <b>x = 14082007</b>. Alice calculates and sends <b>y = x<sup>e</sup> % n</b>. She gets both <b>n</b> and 
            <b>e</b> from the public, shared key. So <b>y = 14082007<sup>65537</sup> % 1000609937 = 306497210</b></p></li>
          <li><p>Bob decrypts the value calculating <b>x = y<sup>d</sup> % n</b>. He gets both <b>n</b> and <b>d</b> from his private, unshared key.
            So <b>x = 306497210<sup>662506613</sup> % 1000609937 = 14082007</b></p></li>
        </ol>

          This way, the message was safely transmitted and is unreadable by any third party, without sending any private keys over the network.
