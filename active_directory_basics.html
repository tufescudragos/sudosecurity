    <h1>Active Directory Basics</h1>
    <p>
      This article introduces the fundamentals of Active Directory (AD), a key technology in Windows networks. 
      You will learn the basic concepts, structure, components, and practical use cases. The goal is to give you 
      a clear understanding of how AD works and how it is used in real-world environments.

      <h2>Windows Domains</h2>
      <section class="content-block">
        <p>
          In a small network, with a few computers and users, configuring and troubleshooting each machine isn't a problem. However, in most cases,
          typical networks contain a large number of computers, servers, printers, users etc. Managing each as a separate entity can become very confusing and repetitive.
          To overcome these challenges, <b>Windows Domains</b> can be used.
        </p>
        <p>
          Simply, a <b>Windows Domain</b> is a group of users and computers under the administration of a given entity. Its main idea is to centralize the administration of 
          common components of a Windows computer network in a single repository called <b>Active Directory(AD)</b>. The server that runs the <b>Active Directory</b> is 
          called <b>Domain Controller(DC)</b>.
        </p>

      <section class="content-block">
        <p>
          Advantages of having a configured <b>Windows Domain</b>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Centralised identity management</b>: all users across the network are set up with minimum effort.</li>
          <li><b>Managing security policies</b>: security policies are configured from the <b>Active Directory</b> and applied to users and computers across the network.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>Active Directories</b> are very common. For example, at the local library, you most likely cannot access the <b>Control Panel</b> on the computers. 
          This is because a security policy prevents you from doing that. Also, it stores credentials, so you can use them on any machine.

      <h2>Active Directory</h2>
      <section class="content-block">
        <p>
          The core of any <b>Windows Domain</b> is the <b>Active Directory Domain Service(AD DS)</b>. This is like a catalogue that holds the information of all the "objects" on the network.
          Amongst the objects supported by <b>AD</b>, there are users, groups, machines, printers, shares and many others. Objects in <b>AD</b>:

            <p>
              <b>Users</b> are one of the most common object types in <b>AD</b>. Users are objects known as <b>security principals</b>, which means that they can be authenticated by the domain 
              and be assigned control over resources like files or printers. <b>Security principal</b> = object that can act upon resources on the network. Users can be:
              <ul>
                <li><b>People</b>: real people that need to access the network, like employees.</li>
                <li><b>Services</b>: services like <b>Kerberos</b> or MSSQL. Every service needs a user to run, but service users only have privileges to run their specific services.</li>

            <p>
              <b>Machines</b>: for every computer that joins the <b>AD</b>, a machine object is created. They are also <b>security principals</b> and are assigned accounts, which are 
              local administrators on the assigned computer and are not supposed to be used on any other computer. Machine account 
              passwords are randomly rotated and are generally comprised of 120 random bits. The machine account name is the 
              computer's name followed by a $.

              <b>Security groups</b>: used to assign access rights to files or other resources to entire 
              groups instead of individual users. <b>security groups</b> are also considered <b>security 
              principals</b>. Groups can have both users and machines as members and can also include 
              other groups.

          Running <b>"Active Directory Users and Computers"</b> on the <b>Domain Controller</b> allows for the configuration of users, groups and machines:
        </p>
        <p>This will open a hierarchy of users, computers and groups that exist on the domain. They are organised in <b>Organizational Units(OUs)</b>. These are container
          objects with the purpose of classifying users and machines. They are mainly used to group users/computers with similar policies. A user can be part of a 
          single <b>OU</b> at a time. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, you can add <b>OUs</b>, organise them, add users, set them up, move them around. You can also access individual user 
          properties, where you can edit names, change passwords, set remote control up etc. Delegations can be set up here too.

          In the photo, we can see that there is an <b>OU</b> called OFFICE with some child <b>OUs</b> for Administrators, IT Department, Personnel, Teachers
           and Workstations. A layout like this is expected, but it is not always used. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Typically, this structure mimics the actual business' structure, because it allows for easier policy deployment.

          Upon opening any <b>OU</b>, you can see its contents and perform tasks like creating, modifying and deleting users. You can also reset passwords,

              In <b>AD</b> you can give specific users control over some <b>OUs</b>. The process is known as <b>delegation</b> and grants specific users 
              privileges to perform advanced tasks without a <b>Domain Administrator</b> stepping in. Let's say we want to give someone in the IT Department

      <h2>Managing Group Policies</h2>
      <section class="content-block">
        <a href="media/images/active_directory/active_directory_basics/active_directory_basics_9.png">
          <img src="media/images/active_directory/active_directory_basics/active_directory_basics_9.png" class="img-right">
        </a>
        <p>
          We have organised users and computers in <b>OUs</b>, but not with any real functionality. The idea is to be able to deploy different policies 
          for each <b>OU</b> individually. This way, we can push different security configurations to users depending on their department.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can manage these properties through <b>Group Policy Objects(GPO)</b>. They are a collection of settings that can be applied to OUs. They contain 
          policies aimed at either users or computers. 
        </p>
        <p>
          To configure them, the <b>Group Policy Management</b> tool is used.
        </p>
        <p>
          The interface might look a bit overwhelming, but is really used to get a grasp on.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first thing you can see is the <b>GPOs</b> hierarchy. To configure a <b>Group Policy</b>, first create a <b>GPO</b> under <b>Group Policy Objects</b>
          and then link it to the <b>OU</b> where you want policies to apply.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can see that there are already 3 <b>GPOs</b> created. The <b>Domain Default Policy</b> is linked to the whole domain, so it has effect over everything.
          The <b>IT Dept Policy</b> is linked to the <b>Teachers OU</b>. It is the delegation we created earlier. The <b>Default Domain Controllers Policy</b> is 
          the default policy applied to <b>Domain Controllers</b> in the domain. Because the <b>Default Domain Policy</b> is at the root, it applies to all <b>OUs</b>,
          which means even the <b>Admins OU</b> will be affected. Any <b>GPO</b> will apply to any linked <b>OU</b> and also all the <b>sub-OUs</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
          We can see in the <b>scope</b> tab that it is only linked to <b>thm.local</b>. This means it applies to the whole domain. Here, we can apply <b>security filtering</b>,
          so that the <b>GPO</b> is only applied to specific users/computers under the <b>OU</b>. <b>Authenticated Users</b> group includes all users and computers.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="content-block">
        <p>
          The settings tab includes the actual contents of the <b>GPO</b> and tells us the specific configurations it applies. Each <b>GPO</b> has a configuration 
          that applies only to users and one that applies to machines only. The <b>Default Domain Policy GPO</b> only contains Computer Configurations. It contains 
          very basic configurations that should apply to most domains, like password and account lockout policies.

          Let's say we want to edit the minimum passwords length for all computers across the whole domain. We will right-click the <b>Default Domain Policy</b>
          and select <b>Edit</b>.

          After double-clicking the option, it is very easy to change it. Also, the <b>Explain</b> tab offers an explanation of the policy.

        <p>
          <b>GPOs</b> are distributed to the network via a share called <code>SYSVOL</code>. It is stored in the <b>DC</b>. Each user should have access to this share 
          to sync their <b>GPOs</b> periodically. The SYSVOL share points by default to <code>C:\Windows\SYSVOL\sysvol</code> directory on each DC.
        </p>
        <p>
          After making changes to <b>GPOs</b>, it might take up to 2 hours for them to update on all computers. You can run the following command on any computer 
          to sync its <b>GPOs</b> immediately:

      <h2>Authentication Methods</h2>
      <section class="content-block">
        <p>
          When using a Windows domain, all authentication credentials are stored on the <b>Domain Controller</b>. Whenever a user tries to communicate with a service
          using domain credentials, the service needs to ask the <b>Domain Controller</b> to verify if they are correct. Two protocols can be use:
        </p>

          <dt><h3>Kerberos</h3> Used by any recent version of Windows. Default protocol in any recent domain</dt>

            <section class="content-block">
              <p>
                Kerberos is a network authentication protocol designed to provide secure authentication between clients and services over an insecure network.
                It was originally developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and is widely used in enterprise environments, especially in 
                Windows Active Directory domains.
              </p>
              <p>
                The main goal of Kerberos is to prevent attackers from intercepting or tampering with authentication data.
                Instead of sending passwords across the network, Kerberos uses tickets and symmetric-key cryptography to prove a user's identity.

          <dt><h3>NetNTLM</h3> Legacy authentication protocol kept for compatibility purposes. It should be considered obsolete, but most networks still have it enabled</dt>

              <p>
                <b>NetNTLM</b> is a challenge-response authentication protocol used primarily in Microsoft Windows networks to authenticate users over network connections.
                It is a successor to the older LAN Manager (LM) and NTLMv1 protocols, designed to improve security while maintaining compatibility with legacy systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>NetNTLM</b> is commonly used in SMB (Server Message Block), HTTP, and other network authentication scenarios where <b>NetNTLM</b> is not available or cannot be used.

      <h2>Trees, Forests and Trusts</h2>
      <section class="content-block">
        <p>
          We have covered how to manage a single domain, the role of a <b>DC</b> and how it manages computers, servers and users.
        </p>
        <a href="media/images/active_directory/active_directory_basics/active_directory_basics_15.png">

          As companies grow, so do their networks. Sometimes, you might need to add new domains.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="content-block">
        <h3>Trees</h3>
        <p>
          You might need, for example, another domain in another country, with different laws and regulations, so different <b>GPOs</b>. <b>Active Directory</b>
          supports integrating multiple domains, so you can partition your network into units that can be managed independently. If you have two domains with the 
          same namespace, for example office.local, you can join them in a <b>Tree</b>.
        </p>
        <a href="media/images/active_directory/active_directory_basics/active_directory_basics_16.png">
          <img src="media/images/active_directory/active_directory_basics/active_directory_basics_16.png" class="img-center">
        </a>
        <p>
          A new security group needs to be introduced with <b>trees</b> and <b>forests</b>. The <b>Enterprise Admins</b> group will grant a user administrative 
          privileges over an enterprise's domains.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="content-block">
        <h3>Forests</h3>
        <p>
          The domains can also be configured in different namespaces. The union of several trees with different namespaces is known as a <b>forest</b>.
          For example, when a company acquires another one.
        </p>
        <a href="media/images/active_directory/active_directory_basics/active_directory_basics_17.png">
          <img src="media/images/active_directory/active_directory_basics/active_directory_basics_17.png" class="img-center">
        </a>
      </section>
      <section class="content-block">
        <h3>Trust Relationships</h3>
        <p>
          At some point, a user on a domain might need to access a file on another domain. For this to happen, domains in <b>trees</b> and <b>forests</b> are joined 
          together by <b>trust relationships</b>.
        </p>
        <a href="media/images/active_directory/active_directory_basics/active_directory_basics_17.png">
          <img src="media/images/active_directory/active_directory_basics/active_directory_basics_18.png" class="img-center">
        </a>
        <p>
          In the picture example, domain 1 trusts domain 2, which means that a user on domain 2 can be authorised to access resources on domain 1. The direction of 
          a one-way trust is contrary to that of the access direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Two-way trust relationships</b> can be made to allow both domains to mutually authorise users from the other. By default, joining domains under a 
          tree or forest forms a two-way trust relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having a trust relationship doesn't automatically allow access over the files, the access still needs to be authorised to be performed.
