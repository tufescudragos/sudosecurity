    <h1>Active Directory Basics</h1>
    <p>
      This article introduces the fundamentals of Active Directory (AD), a key technology in Windows networks. 
      You will learn the basic concepts, structure, components, and practical use cases. The goal is to give you 
      a clear understanding of how AD works and how it is used in real-world environments.

      <h2>Windows Domains</h2>
      <p>
        In a small network, with a few computers and users, configuring and troubleshooting each machine isn't a problem. However, in most cases,
        typical networks contain a large number of computers, servers, printers, users etc. Managing each as a separate entity can become very confusing and repetitive.
        To overcome these challanges, <b>Windows Domains</b> can be used.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simply, a <b>Windows Domain</b> is a group of users and computers under the administration of a given entity. Its main idea is to centralise the administration of 
        common components of a Windows computer network in a single repository called <b>Active Directory(AD)</b>. The server that runs the <b>Active Directory</b> is 
        called <b>Domain Controller(DC)</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Advantages of having a configured <b>Windows Domain</b>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Centralised identity management</b>: all users across the network are set up with minimum effort.</li>
        <li><b>Managing security policies</b>: security policies are configured from the <b>Active Directory</b> and applied to users and computers across the network.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Active Directories</b> are very common. For example, at the local library, you most likely cannot access the <b>Control Panel</b> on the computers. 
        This is because a security policy prevents you from doing that. Also, it stores credidentials, so you can use them on any machine.
