    <h1>Active Directory Basics</h1>
    <p>
      This article introduces the fundamentals of Active Directory (AD), a key technology in Windows networks. 
      You will learn the basic concepts, structure, components, and practical use cases. The goal is to give you 
      a clear understanding of how AD works and how it is used in real-world environments.

      <h2>Windows Domains</h2>

        <p>
          In a small network, with a few computers and users, configuring and troubleshooting each machine isn't a problem. However, in most cases,
          typical networks contain a large number of computers, servers, printers, users etc. Managing each as a separate entity can become very confusing and repetitive.
          To overcome these challanges, <b>Windows Domains</b> can be used.
        </p>
        <p>
          Simply, a <b>Windows Domain</b> is a group of users and computers under the administration of a given entity. Its main idea is to centralise the administration of 
          common components of a Windows computer network in a single repository called <b>Active Directory(AD)</b>. The server that runs the <b>Active Directory</b> is 
          called <b>Domain Controller(DC)</b>.
        </p>

      <section class="content-block">
        <p>
          Advantages of having a configured <b>Windows Domain</b>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Centralised identity management</b>: all users across the network are set up with minimum effort.</li>
          <li><b>Managing security policies</b>: security policies are configured from the <b>Active Directory</b> and applied to users and computers across the network.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>Active Directories</b> are very common. For example, at the local library, you most likely cannot access the <b>Control Panel</b> on the computers. 
          This is because a security policy prevents you from doing that. Also, it stores credidentials, so you can use them on any machine.

      <h2>Active Directory</h2>
      <section class="content-block">
        <p>
          The core of any <b>Windows Domain</b> is the <b>Active Directory Domain Service(AD DS)</b>. This is like a catalogue that holds the information of all the "objects" on the network.
          Amongst the objects supported by <b>AD</b>, there are users, groups, machines, printers, shares and many other. Objects in <b>AD</b>:
        </p>

          <section class="content-block">
            <p>
              <b>Users</b> are one of the most common onject types in <b>AD</b>. Users are objects known as <b>security principals</b>, which means that they can be authenticated by the domain 
              and be assigned control over resources like files or printers. <b>Security principal</b> = object that can act upon resources on the network. Users can be:
              <ul>
                <li><b>People</b>: real people that need to access the network, like employees.</li>
                <li><b>Services</b>: services like <b>Kerberos</b> or MSSQL. Every service needs a user to run, but service users only have privileges to run their specific services.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

          <section class="content-block">
            <p>
              <b>Machines</b>: for every computer that joins the <b>AD</b>, a machine object is created. They are also <b>security principals</b> and are assigned accounts, which are 
              local administrators on the assigned computer and are not supposed to be used on any other computer. Machine account 
              passwords are randomly rotated and are generally comprised of 120 random characters. The machine account name is the 
              computer's name followed by a $.

              <b>Security groups</b>: used to assign acces rights to files or other resources to entire 
              groups instead of individual users. <b>security groups</b> are also considered <b>security 
              principals</b>. Groups can have both users and machines as members and can also include 
              other groups.
            </p>
            <p>Several groups are created by default in a domain:

                <dt><b>Domain Admins</b></dt>
                <dd>Administrative privileges over the entire domain, including <b>DCs</b>.</dd>
                <dt><b>Server Operators</b></dt>
                <dd>Can administer <b>Domain Controllers</b>. Cannot change any administrative group memberships.</dd>
                <dt><b>Backup Operators</b></dt>
                <dd>Can access any file. Used to perform backups of data on computers.</dd>

          Running <b>"Active Directory Users and Computers"</b> on the <b>Domain Controller</b> allows for the configuration of users, groups and machines:
        </p>
        <p>This will open a hirearchy of users, computers and groups that exist on the domain. They are organised in <b>Organisation Units(OUs)</b>. These are container
          objects with the purpose of classifying users and machines. They are mainly used to group users/computers with similar policies. A user can be part of a 
          single <b>OU</b> at a time. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, you can add <b>OUs</b>, organise them, add users, set them up, move them around. You can also access individual user 
          properties, where you can edit names, change passwords, set remote control up etc. Delegations can be set up here to.

          In the photo, we can see that there is an <b>OU</b> called OFFICE with some child <b>OUs</b> for Administrators, IT Department, Personnel, Teachers
           and Workstations. A layout like this is expected, but it is not always used. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Typically, this structure mimmics the actual business' structure, because it allows for easier policy deployment.

          Upon opening any <b>OU</b>, you can see its contents and perform tasks like creating, modifying and deleting users. You can also reset passwords, 
          force password reset at logon, send mail, disable accounts and more.

          There are some default containers apart from the OFFICE. They are automatically configured by Windows.
          <ul>
            <li><b>Builtin</b>: Contains default groups available to any Windows host.</li>
            <li><b>Computers</b>: Any machine that joins the domain gets put here by defaut and can be moved as needed.</li>
            <li><b>Domain Controllers</b>: Contains the <b>DCs</b> by default.</li>
            <li><b>Users</b>: Default users and groups.</li>

                By default, <b>OUs</b> are protected against accidental deletion. To disable that, enable <b>Advanced Features</b> in the <b>View</b> menu.

                This will show additional containers and will allow to disable the accidental deletion protection. Right-click the <b>OU</b>, go to <b>Properties</b>
                and disable it in the <b>Object</b> tab.

                After unchecking the box, you can right-click on the <b>OU</b> and finally delete it.
              </p>
              <p>
                To delete an user, you can just right-click it and press <b>Delete</b>.

              In <b>AD</b> you can give specific users control over some <b>OUs</b>. The process is known as <b>delegation</b> and grants specific users 
              privileges to perform advanced tasks without a <b>Domain Administrator</b> stepping in. Let's say we want to give someone in the IT Department 
              the ability to reset the Teachers' passwords. Right-click the <b>OU</b>, press <b>Delegate Control</b>.

              Enter the name and press <b>Check Names</b> to make sure it's correct. Then press <b>Next</b>. In this next tab, you can select tasks to delegate.

              Press <b>Next</b>, then <b>Finish</b> and now Li Wey can change the password of anyone in Teachers.

            <p>
              If now <code>Li Wey</code> tries to change <code>Olivia Smith's</code> password through the same <b>Active Directory Users and Computers</b>, he won't
              be able, because he does not have enough privileges to open it. Instead, he has to use <b>powershell</b>:
            </p>
            <pre><code>PS C:\Users\liwey> Set-ADAccountPassword oliviasmith -Reset -NewPassword (Read-Host `
-AsSecureString -Prompt 'New Password')
New Password: ********</code></pre>
            <p>
              We can force a password reset at next logon:
            </p>
            <code>PS C:\Users\liwey> Set-ADUser -ChangePasswordAtLogon $true -Identity oliviasmith</code>
            <p>
              <b>Note</b>: to use <b>Active Directory</b> related cmdlets and software, <b>Remote Server Administration Tools</b> need to be installed on the computer.
              The administrator account has to run:
