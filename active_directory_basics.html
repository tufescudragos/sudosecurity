    <h1>Active Directory Basics</h1>
    <p>
      This article introduces the fundamentals of Active Directory (AD), a key technology in Windows networks. 
      You will learn the basic concepts, structure, components, and practical use cases. The goal is to give you 
      a clear understanding of how AD works and how it is used in real-world environments.

      <h2>Windows Domains</h2>
      <p>
        In a small network, with a few computers and users, configuring and troubleshooting each machine isn't a problem. However, in most cases,
        typical networks contain a large number of computers, servers, printers, users etc. Managing each as a separate entity can become very confusing and repetitive.
        To overcome these challanges, <b>Windows Domains</b> can be used.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simply, a <b>Windows Domain</b> is a group of users and computers under the administration of a given entity. Its main idea is to centralise the administration of 
        common components of a Windows computer network in a single repository called <b>Active Directory(AD)</b>. The server that runs the <b>Active Directory</b> is 
        called <b>Domain Controller(DC)</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Advantages of having a configured <b>Windows Domain</b>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Centralised identity management</b>: all users across the network are set up with minimum effort.</li>
        <li><b>Managing security policies</b>: security policies are configured from the <b>Active Directory</b> and applied to users and computers across the network.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Active Directories</b> are very common. For example, at the local library, you most likely cannot access the <b>Control Panel</b> on the computers. 
        This is because a security policy prevents you from doing that. Also, it stores credidentials, so you can use them on any machine.

      <h2>Active Directory</h2>
      <p>
        The core of ant <b>Windows Domain</b> is the <b>Active Directory Domain Service(AD DS)</b>. This is like a catalogue that holds the information of all the "objects" on the network.
        Amongst the objects supported by <b>AD</b>, there are users, groups, machines, printers, shares and many other. Objects in <b>AD</b>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Users</b> are one of the most common onject types in <b>AD</b>. Users are objects known as <b>security principals</b>, which means that they can be authenticated by the domain 
            and be assigned control over resources like files or printers. <b>Security principal</b> = object that can act upon resources on the network. Users can be:
            <ul>
              <li><b>People</b>: real people that need to access the network, like employees.</li>
              <li><b>Services</b>: services like <b>Kerberos</b> or MSSQL. Every service needs a user to run, but service users only have privileges to run their specific services.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Machines</b>: for every computer that joins the <b>AD</b>, a machine object is created. They are also <b>security principals</b> and are assigned accounts, which are 
            local administrators on the assigned computer and are not supposed to be used on any other computer. Machine account 
            passwords are randomly rotated and are generally comprised of 120 random characters. The machine account name is the 
            computer's name followed by a $.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Security groups</b>: used to assign acces rights to files or other resources to entire 
            groups instead of individual users. <b>security groups</b> are also considered <b>security 
            principals</b>. Groups can have both users and machines as members and can also include 
            other groups.
          </p>
          <p>Several groups are created by default in a domain:
            <dl>
              <dt><b>Domain Admins</b></dt>
              <dd>Administrative privileges over the entire domain, including <b>DCs</b>.</dd>
              <dt><b>Server Operators</b></dt>
              <dd>Can administer <b>Domain Controllers</b>. Cannot change any administrative group memberships.</dd>
              <dt><b>Backup Operators</b></dt>
              <dd>Can access any file. Used to perform backups of data on computers.</dd>
              <dt><b>Account Operators</b></dt>
              <dd>Can create or modify other accounts in domain.</dd>
              <dt><b>Domain Computers</b></dt>
              <dd>All existing computers in the domain.</dd>
              <dt><b>Domain Controllers</b></dt>
              <dd>All existing <b>DCs</b> on the domain.</dd>
            </dl>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
