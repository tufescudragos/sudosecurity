    <main>
        <p>&ensp;nmap is an open-source tool used for network discovery and security auditing. it can be used for discovering which systems are up and what services are runnning on these systems.</p>
            <p>&ensp;steps in typical nmap scan:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>enumerating the targets</li>
            <li>discovering the live hosts</li>
            <li>reverse-DNS lookup</li>
            <li>scanning the ports</li>
            <li>detecting the OS</li>
            <li>traceroute</li>
            <li>using scripts</li>
            <li>writing the output</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>live host discovery</h2>
            <p>&ensp;discovering the online systems is essential, as trying to port-scan offline systems consumes a lot of time and creates unnecessary noise on the network. by default,
            nmap discovers the live hosts and then port-scans the live hosts only. to disable port-scanning, we use the <code>-sn</code> flag.
            </p>
            <p>&ensp;ARP(address resolution protocol) is a network protocol used to map an IP address to its corresponding MAC address within
                a local network, so that communication can take place. it only operates on the same subnet.</p>
            <p>&ensp;ICMP(internet control message protocol) is a network protocol used for sending error messages and operational information, mainly to  diagnose network communication issues(e. g. with the ping command).</p>
            <p>&ensp;TCP(transmission control protocol) is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable communication between applications by using acknowledgments, retransmissions and error checking.</p>
            <p>&ensp;UDP(user datagram protocol) is a connectionless protocol that sends data without guaranteeing delivery, making it faster but less reliable, often used for streaming, gaming or VoIP.</p>
            <h3>reverse-DNS lookup</h3>
            <p>&ensp;nmap's default behaviour is to use reverse-DNS lookup. this can be helpful, but time consuming. you can use <code>-n</code> flag to skip it or <code>-R</code> flag to force it even on offline hosts.

            <h3>enumerating targets</h3>
            <p>&ensp;general layout of Nmap: 
            <code>nmap [options] [targets]</code> 
            </p>
            <p>&ensp;ways to specify targets:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>subnet: <code>192.168.1.0/24</code> will scan the whole subnet(256IPs)</li>
                <li>range: <code>192.168.1.0-4</code> will scan 5 Ips: 
                <code>192.168.1.0</code>, <code>192.168.1.1</code> ... <code>192.168.1.4</code></li>
                <li>files : <code>nmap -iL list.txt</code> will scan all IPs in list.txt file</li>
                <li>list: <code>192.168.1.0</code>, <code>192.168.0.9</code>, <code>192.168.0.45</code> will scan 4 IPs</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&ensp;to list all the IPs that are going to be scanned you can use the <code>-sL</code> flag :</p>
            <code>nmap -sL 192.168.1.0/30</code>
            <p>&ensp;output:</p>

            <h3>host discovery using ARP</h3>
            <p>&ensp;ARP scan is only possible if you are on the same subnet as your targets. on ethernet and wifi, you have to know the MAC addresses of the target systems, in order to communicate with them. to obtain it, the OS sends an ARP query.
                a host that replies to the ARP query is up. we expect to see many ARP queries when scanning a local network.
            </p>
            <p>&ensp;we can force Nmap to use ARP for host discovery by using the <code>-PR</code> flag.</p>

            <p>&ensp;example: <code>nmap -PR -sn 192.168.1.0/24</code> (this will scan the whole subnet):</p>

        <section>
            <h3>host dicovery using ICMP</h3>
            <p>&ensp;we can ping all IPs on the network with ICMP echo requests(ICMP Type 8) and see who replies with ICMP ping reply(ICMP Type 0). it is straightforward, but many firewalls and modern Windows versions block
                ICMP pings by default. ARP query will precede the ICMP request, if you and the target both are on the same subnet.</p>
            <p>&ensp;to use ICMP echo requests to discover live hosts, use <code>-PE</code> flag. remember that many firewalls block ICMP.</p>
            <p>&ensp;we don't expect to learn MAC addresses, unless we're on the same subnet as the target.</p>
            <p>example: <code>nmap -PE -sn 192.168.1.0/24</code></p>
            <p>&ensp;because ICMP echo requests tend to be blocked, you can use ICMP timestamp request(ICMP Type 13) and
                see who replies with Timestamp reply(ICMP Type 14). adding <code>-PP</code> flag tells Nmap to do that. </p>
            <p>&ensp;we can also include <code>-PM</code> flag to use Address mask queries(ICMP Type 17) and see who replies
                with Address mask reply(ICMP Type 18).
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Host discovery using TCP/UDP</h3>
            <p>&ensp;We can send a packet with SYN(Synchronise) flag to a TCP port, 80 by default. An open port should reply with SYN/ACK(Acknowledge),
                while a closed one should reply with RST(Reset). We do not care what response we receive, only whether or not
                we receive one.
            </p>
            <p>&ensp;To use TCP SYN ping, we specify the <code>-PS</code> flag. Privileged users can send TCP SYN packets and 
                don't need to complete the 3-way handshake. Unprivileged users have to.
            </p>

            <p>&ensp;To use TCP ACK ping, you need to be privileged user. It works by sending an ACK flag to a TCP port(80 by default).
                The port should reply with RST flag, regardless of the state it has. We can tell Nmap to use this type of scan 
                by specifying the <code>-PA</code> flag.    
            </p>
            <img src="nmap_media/nmap_PA.png" alt="-PA illustration" height="200">
            <p>&ensp;We can use UDP to discover if the host is online. Sending a UDP packet to an open port is not expected to 
                lead to a reply, but sending to a closed port results in a ICMP port unreachable reply. Nmap sends UDP packets
                to high, most likely unused ports. We can use the <code>-PU</code> flag to tell it to use UDP scan.

        <h2>Basic port scans</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>TCP and UDP ports</h3>
            <p>&ensp;Like an IP address identifies a host on a netowork, a TCP or UDP port identifies a networking service 
                on a host. Ports are usually linked to specific services, for example HTTP on TCP port 80, SSH on TCP
                port 22. No more than one service can listen on any port.
            </p>
            <p>&ensp;A port can be open, which means a service is listening on it, or closed, which means no service is 
                listening on the port. In practical situations, a firewall or other security measure might block packets,
                so Nmap recognises 6 port states: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Open: a service is listening on the port.</li>
                <li>Closed: no service is listening on the port, but it is accesible(it is reachable and not blocked
                    by a firewall or another security measure).</li>
                <li>Filtered: Nmap cannot determine if the port is open or closed, because it is inaccesible.
                    Usually due to a firewall preventing Nmap from reaching the target or the target from reaching Nmap.
                </li>
                <li>Unfiltered: Nmap cannot determine if the port is open or closed, but it is accesible.</li>
                <li>Open|Filtered: Nmap cannot determine if the port is open or filtered.</li>
                <li>Closed|Filtered: Nmap cannot determine if the port is closed or filtered.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>TCP flags</h3>
            <p>&ensp;A TCP segment can have one or many TCP flags, located in its header. They can be either set
                or unset:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>URG - The incoming data is urgent, the segment will be processed immediately, without waiting for others.</li>
                <li>ACK - Used to acknowledge the receipt of a TCP segment.</li>
                <li>PSH - Push flag asking TCP to pass the data to the application promptly.</li>
                <li>RST - Reset flag used to reset the connection.</li>
                <li>SYN - Synchronise flag used to initiate 3-way handshake and synchronise 
                    sequence numbers with host.</li>
                <li>FIN - The sender has no more data to send.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>TCP connect scan</h3>
            <p>&ensp;The TCP connect scan works by completing the 3-way handshake. After, it sends a RST/ACK flag to tear it.
				If you are unprivileged user, TCP connect scan is the only way to discover open TCP ports. 
				To use it, we can include the <code>-sT</code> flag. The <code>-F</code> flag decreases the number of ports
				scanned, from 1000 to 100 most common ports.
			</p>
			<img src="nmap_media/nmap_sT.png" alt="-sT illustration" height="200">
			<p>Example: <code>nmap -sT 192.168.1.11</code></p>

			<h3>TCP SYN scan</h3>
			<p>&ensp;SYN scan does not complete the 3-way handshake. It tears the connection once it receives a response from 
				the target. Because we didn't establish a connection, it is much more stealthier. It can be used with the flag
				<code>-sS</code>.

			<img src="nmap_media/nmap_sS.png" alt="-sS illustration" height="200">
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>UDP scan</h3>
			<p>&ensp;UDP is a connectionless protocol, it does not require any handshake. We cannot guarantee that a service
				listening on a UDP port will reply, but if a UDP packet is sent to a closed port, it will return an ICMP port
				unreachable error(ICMP Type 3, Code 3). You can use this flag with the <code>-sU</code> flag, and it can be combined
				with other TCP scans.

			<h3>Choosing ports, speed and parallelization</h3>
			<p>&ensp;By default, Nmap scans the most common(top) 1000 ports. You can use:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>-p21,23,8080</code> to scan ports 21,23,8080</li>
				<li><code>-p1-10</code> to scan 10 ports</li>
				<li><code>-p-</code> to scan all 65 thousand ports</li>
				<li><code>-F</code> to scan most common 100 ports</li>
				<li><code>--top-ports 50</code> to scan 50 most common ports</li>
			</ul>
			<p>&ensp;You can control the speed using <code>-T0-5</code>. Different speeds:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>0-paranoid</li>
				<li>1-sneaky(used in real world scenarious)</li>
				<li>2-polite</li>
				<li>3-normal</li>
				<li>4-aggresive(used in CTFs)</li>
				<li>5-insane</li>
			</ul>
			<p>&ensp;You can control packet rate with <code>--min-rate [number]</code> and <code>--max-rate [number]</code>.
				You can control probing parallelization with <code>--min-parallelism [numprobes]</code>
				and <code>--max-probes [numprobes]</code>.</p>

        <h2>Advanced port scans</h2>
        <p>&ensp;Security researchers and hackers combined different TCP flags in segments and started to experiment.
            They wanted to find out what happens if we send a TCP packet with some flags set, when it is not part
            of any connection.
        </p>
        <section>
            <h3>Different scan types</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Null scan: with <code>-sN</code> flag, has no TCP flags. A null packet sent to an open port 
                    doesn't generate any response. Sent to a closed one, returns a RST/ACK response. It cannot determine 
                    whether the port is open or closed.</li>

                <li>FIN scan: with <code>-sF</code> flag, has only FIN flag set. A FIN packet sent to on open port
                    doesn't generate any response. Sent to a closed one, returns a TCP/ACK packet. It cannot determine

                    It is only usefull to detect firewall rules, which ports are blocked and which ports
                    are not. It is ineffective against targets without firewalls.</li>

            <h3>Spoofing and decoys</h3>
            <p>&ensp;In some network setups, you will be able to scan a target system with a spoofed IP address and
                even MAC address. You can use this only when you can guarantee to capture the response. Scanning on random 
                networks using a spoofed IP address would return unreliable results, unless you have the response routed to 
                you.</p>
            <p>&ensp;The attacker needs to monitor the network traffic to analyse replies. Steps for scanning with 
                spoofed IPs:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Attacker sends a packet with a spoofed source IP address to the target machine.</li>
                <li>The target machine replies to the spoofed IP address as the destination.</li>
                <li>Attacker captures the replies to figure out open ports.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>&ensp;In general, it is expected to specify the network interface with <code>-e NET-INTERFACE</code> 
                and explicitly disable ping scan with <code>-Pn</code> flag. The attack is useless if the attacker 
                doesn't monitor the network for responses.</p>
            <p>&ensp;You can also spoof MAC addresses with <code>--spoof-mac SPOOFED_MAC</code>, but only if you are on the 
                same subnet.</p>
            <p>&ensp;Spoofing only works in minimal number of cases, where certain conditions are met. The attacker 
                might also use decoys to make it harder to be pinpointed. The concept is to make the scan appear to 
                be coming from many IP addresses, so the attacker's IP is lost among them. You can do this with :</p>
            <p><code>-D IPs</code>. You can use <code>ME</code> to indicate your IP address or <code>RND</code> for 
                random IP addresses.</p>
            <p>Example: <code>nmap -D 192.168.1.12,192.168.1.67,ME,RND</code></p>

            <h3>Fragmented packets</h3>
            <p>&ensp;You can fragment packets to make it harder for IDS or Firewall to detect them. You can use 
                <code>-f</code> to divide the IP data into 8 bytes or less. It is stackable, so <code>-ff</code> divides
                it into 16. You can increase the size of the packets with <code>--data-length NUM</code>.
            </p>
            <p>&ensp;You can use <code>--source-port PORT</code> flag to specify the source port.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Verbosity</h3>
            <p>&ensp;You can adjust the verbosity of the output with <code>-v</code> flag. It is stackable up to 
                <code>-vvvvv</code>. <code>--reason</code> flag displays the reason why Nmap classified a port's state.
                You can also use <code>-d</code> to print debugging details. It is stackable too.</p>

        <h2>Post port scans</h2>
        <p>&ensp;In this article, we will be focusing on how Nmap can be used to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Detect versions of running services</li>
            <li>Detect the OS based on any signs </li>
            <li>Run Nmap's traceroute</li>
            <li>Run Nmap scripts</li>
            <li>Save results in various formats</li>
        </ul>
        <section>
            <h3>Service detection, OS detection and traceroute. Saving the results.</h3>
            <p>&ensp;Including <code>-sV</code> flag will collect and determine services and 
                version information for the open ports. The level of information can 
                be specified with <code>--version-intensity LEVEL</code> where LEVEL
                can take a value between 0 and 9. 0 is least amount of details, 
                9 the most. Also, using <code>-sV</code> forces Nmap to complete the 3-way handshake</p>
            <p>&ensp;Nmap can attempt to determine the host OS, when given the <code>-O</code> flag.
                It can also attempt to find routes between you and the target, using <code>--traceroute</code>.</p>
            <p>&ensp;Nmap can save the output in 3 different formats: normal format(using <code>-oA</code> flag),
            <code>grep</code>able format(using <code>-oG</code> flag) or XML format(using <code>-oX</code> flag).</p>
            <p>&ensp;<code>-oA</code> flag can be used to save in all formats. Also, you have to specify the filename, along with these flags. For example, adding -oN output to the command will save it as a file named output.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Nmap scripting engine</h3>
            <p>&ensp;A script is a sequence of instructions that can be executed by a 
                computer or programming language, typically used to automate tasks that
                would otherwise be performed manually. In Nmap, a script can reveal 
                additional information about the host or ports and services running on it.
                These can be used to exploit vulnerabilities or help compromise the system.
            </p>
            <p>&ensp;The default Nmap installation contains about 600 scripts, located 
                in the <code>/usr/share/nmap/scripts</code>. Script categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>auth: authentication related scripts</li>
                <li>broadcast: discover hosts by sending broadcast messages</li>
                <li>brute: performs brute-force passwords auditing against logins</li>
                <li>default: default scripts, same as <code>--script=default</code></li>
                <li>discovery: retrieve accesible information, such as database tables and DNS names</li>
                <li>dos: detects servers vulnerable to Denial of Service(DoS)</li>
                <li>exploit: attempt to exploit various vulnerable services</li>
                <li>external: checks using a third-party service, such as Geoplugin and Virustotal</li>
                <li>fuzzer: launch fuzzing attacks</li>
                <li>intrusive: intrusive scripts such as brute-force attacks and exploitation</li>
                <li>malware: scans for backdoors</li>
                <li>safe: safe scripts that won't crash the target</li>
                <li>version: retrieve service versions</li>
                <li>vuln: check for vulnerabilities or exploit vulnerable services</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&ensp;You can choose a script using <code>--script SCRIPT-NAME</code>. You can use more scripts with wildcards.</p>
